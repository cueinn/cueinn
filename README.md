Ol√°!
I'm a Brazilian generalist designer. In the past 14 years, I done a little bit of everything in design: from Webdesign to Service Design. In my roots the line between design and code was more blurred, and I belive we still have a lot to explore in this area.

So I'm getting back to code. Last time I delivered a fully coded design was 2017. A lot has changed. It's time to catch up.
